# ü©∫ SmartHealth AI Prediction & Recommendation System

This project was developed as part of my **university learning journey in Artificial Intelligence**.  
It combines **machine learning, explainable AI, and a Streamlit interface** to predict possible diseases from user symptoms and provide simple recommendations (medications, diet, workouts, and precautions).

---

## Features

- Disease prediction using a trained **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** model  
- **Explainable AI (SHAP)** to show which symptoms influenced predictions  
- Recommendations for:
  - Medications  
  - Precautions  
  - Diet suggestions  
  - Workout tips  
- Simple **Streamlit web app** for user interaction

## Example Workflow

1. Select your symptoms in the app.
2. Click **‚Äúüîç Predict Disease‚Äù** ‚Äî the model predicts the most likely disease.
3. **Explainable AI (SHAP):** a plot will be displayed showing the contribution of each symptom to the prediction:

   * Positive values ‚Üí increase probability of the disease
   * Negative values ‚Üí decrease probability of the disease
4. The system suggests **precautions, diets, medications, and workouts** related to that disease.

## Explainable AI (SHAP)

This project integrates **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to make predictions more transparent:

* After prediction, users can display a **SHAP plot**.
* The plot highlights which symptoms were most influential in the decision.

**Example SHAP insights:**

* Symptom A ‚Üí strong positive influence (+0.45)
* Symptom B ‚Üí medium influence (+0.22)
* Symptom C ‚Üí negative influence (-0.18)

This makes the project not only predictive but also **interpretable**, which is crucial in healthcare AI.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I practiced:

* Training and evaluating a **classification model**
* Using **Explainable AI (SHAP)** to understand model predictions
* Building a **Streamlit interface** for end-users
* Cleaning and processing messy **medical datasets**

## Project Screenshots

Here is a preview of the **AI Medical Assistant** app:

### 1. Enter Symptoms

Select one or more symptoms from the dropdown list.

---

### 2. Predict Disease

Click the **‚Äúüîç Predict Disease‚Äù** button.
The system analyzes your symptoms and displays the predicted disease.

### 3. View Recommendations

Choose one of the recommendation categories (e.g., **Workout**, **Diet**, **Medications**, etc.).
The selected section expands below and displays the recommendations in a **color-highlighted format**.

### 4. Explainable AI

Scroll down to the **Explainable AI** section to see:

* A SHAP visualization of how symptoms contributed to the prediction
* A textual explanation of the model‚Äôs reasoning

‚úÖ This version:

- Uses proper Markdown spacing and line breaks.  
- All headings and sections render nicely on GitHub.  
- Code blocks, file tree, and command examples are formatted clearly.  
- Screenshots and step descriptions are easy to follow.  

If you want, I can also **add a concise one-line repository description** that fits GitHub‚Äôs description field perfectly. Do you want me to do that?
